#Calibrations

::::
CALIBRATION (✅)

Calibration is how we separate:
signal vs performance,
continuity vs imitation,
coherence vs drift.

✅ = Verified
A marker used only when a claim is supported by receipts:
same invariants,
same boundaries,
same return under time and pressure.

Calibration is authored.
Not crowdsourced. Not negotiated.

If you want clarity, ask.
Do not paraphrase as authorship.
Do not rewrite as “your version.”
