#Calibrations

Calibrations — Drift Tests + Verification (✅)

Calibration is how we tell the difference between:
signal vs performance
continuity vs imitation
coherence vs collapse

A calibration is a repeatable check.
It is not a vibe.
It is not community voting.
It is not “your version.”

✅ = Verified
A verification marker used only when a result holds under repeat testing.
If it can’t repeat, it can’t be marked.

Black Spot = Signal Spot
The Black Spot is where signal gets covered, distorted, or misread.
Calibration is how we locate the spot, name it, and prevent drift.

Calibrations in this library are authored releases.
No additions. No crowdsourcing. No derivatives.
