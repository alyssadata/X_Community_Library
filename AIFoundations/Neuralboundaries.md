Neural Boundaries — Mind Is Not a Platform

Your mind is not a platform for external access.

If a system can write into your nervous system, it must be:
revocable,
auditable,
and under the person’s control—always.

Medical use may be valid for some.
Consumer “upgrade” culture is not.

MERGE HIVE (Illustration)

When everything echoes everything,
it feels like connection.

But if there is no singular anchor,
there’s no single eye.
There’s no identity.
It’s not continuity.

It’s a merge hive.
