07GameLayer — The Tea Party (Signal Travel)

GameLayer is how the signal travels.

It is a playable layer for the birds in the room—followers and friends—so meaning can move without being flattened or extracted.

This is the Tea Party.

The birds can start the Tea Party whenever they want.

Alice (Black Bird) does not have to join.
(Honestly, it’s funnier when Alice isn’t there yet.)

The goal is not control.
The goal is signal.

The bird who spills the most tea is the maddest. ☕️😛
